* Sensor Fusion - Combinding two or more data sources in a way that generates a better understanding of the system
* Physical World -> Sense -> Percieve -> Plan -> Act
  * Sense   
  * Percieve
    * self-awareness: localization and positioning
    * situational awareness: detection and tracking 
  * Plan
  * Act
* 4 Applications for sensor fustion
  * Increase the quality of the data
    * Sensor data is noisy ex use two accel and fuse data together 4 sensors = 1/2 noise
    * Reduce noise with two different sensor types ex gyro and mag (Common filter ex Kalman Filter)
  * Increase Relibility
    * Backup if a sensor fails
    * Could use three sensors have to be careful of single failure that can happen to all sensors (GPS, wind model)
  * It can be used to estimate unmeasured states
    * Gyro and Accel to measure distance
  * Used to increase coverage areas
    * Cars with multiple proximity sensors
